## Changing Models

To switch to a different model:
```bash
./launch_transcriber.sh --change-model
```

This will:
1. Show your current model and its characteristics
2. Let you choose a new model
3. Handle the download and switch automatically

## Model Storage and Management

Models are stored in the Hugging Face cache directory:
```
~/.cache/huggingface/hub/
```

For advanced users:
- Models are shared between applications using Whisper
- Each model is stored in: `models--guillaumekln--faster-whisper-{model_name}`
- You can manually delete models from this directory if needed
- The app will automatically download models again if needed

## Troubleshooting

1. **No menu bar icon?**
   - Make sure you're running from the correct directory
   - Check the logs in `transcriber.log`

2. **Model download fails?**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you have enough disk space
   - Try a smaller model first

3. **Transcription not working?**
   - Make sure your microphone is working and permitted
   - Check if the model was downloaded successfully
   - Try restarting the application

## Logs
